# Make a choice
### Elevator Pitch
Do you ever feel overwhelmed by too many options and you just don't know which one to choose? The Make A Choice application will help you break down your decisions into smaller pieces so you can be confident in your choice. As you compare options one by one, your smaller selections will eventually lead you to be confident in what you have deemed the best choice of all.

### Technologies
I will use the required technologies in these ways:
+ **HTML -** Use HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for logging in, one for the decision process, one to see any past decisions made from your account. Hyperlinks between pages.
+ **CSS -** Styling the application to look good on cell phones and laptop/desktop screens using whitespace and colors.
+ **JavaScript -** Used for login, decision process, displaying winning options and previous choices, and connecting to backend.
+ **Service -** Backend service with endpoints to:
    - login
    - accessing options
    - making choices
    - winning choice
+ **DB -** Store user information, options, and winning choices.
+ **Login -** Register users. Login information securely stored in database.
+ **WebSocket -** User's choices will determine next set of options.
+ **React -** Application ported to use React framework.
